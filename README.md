GIMP Collection Grid Maker
=====================
This is a GIMP plugin that generates a new document from a selected list of image files. The files are inserted into the document as layers and arranged in a grid. 

## Motivation

I originally made this as a way to quickly create a typology from a large number of images. I now use it to make simple collages.

## Install

To build and install it, just ...

	./configure
	make
	make install
